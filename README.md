# NFL Offensive Trends Analysis

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing the trends in offensive performance in the National Football League (NFL) from 2003 to 2023. By examining key offensive metrics such as points scored, passing yards, and rushing yards over this period, we aim to uncover insights into the evolving nature of offensive strategies in professional football.

## Dataset Used
The dataset used in this analysis contains extensive NFL regular season team statistics for the last 21 seasons, covering various aspects of offensive performance such as wins, losses, points scored, passing yards, rushing yards, and more. The data is sourced from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/).

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Descriptive statistics and visualizations are used to explore the trends in offensive performance metrics over time.
3. **Trend Analysis:** Time series analysis is performed to identify trends in key offensive metrics such as points scored, passing yards, and rushing yards.
4. **Interpretation:** The findings from the analysis are interpreted to draw conclusions about the changing nature of NFL offenses from 2003 to 2023.
5. **Future Directions:** Suggestions for future research directions are provided, including deep dives into passing offenses, comparative analysis of offensive strategies, and predictive modeling.
